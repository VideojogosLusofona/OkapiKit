# Release Notes

## V1.15.2

- 'Else' trigger on conditions and input will no longer throw an exception when an action is null

## V1.15.1

- Trigger will no longer throw an exception when an action is null
- Removed some GC from condition evaluation

## V1.14.1

- Fixed issue with builds in version V1.14.0

## V1.14.0

- Added InputRotatesSprite and VelocityRotatesSprite to Flip Behaviour on platformer controller. Rotating instead of scaling changes the actual objects direction, so it can affect other movement systems, for example.
- Movement components can now have conditions built in which take care of activating/deactivating that movement
- Added Dash action, which enable short bursts of movement, using variables or values
- Improved display of title on Change Value action

- Fixed issue with Platformer movement - only non-trigger colliders can set the ground property
- Probes can now be identified by tag
- Follow path can now happen in normalized space, instead of constant speed
- Change transform action now can be scaled with time, can multiply/divide and can affect scaling as well as position

- Created structure to allow for in the future variables, literals or functions to be used as values for most things (internals)
- Added deprecated directories for scripts that will eventually be phased out

## V1.12.0

## V1.9.2

- Fixed bug with ranges on ChangeMovement (changing velocity range would set the wrong values when X and Y had different ranges)

## V1.9.1

- Added tooltips to all Okapi elements
- Added tooltips to many of the debug/warning/error messages in the components, hover cursor for some hints
- Fixed issue with Display Text formatter with int/float type mismatch (for example, now {0:D6} works for having text with 6 digits, even if the number is a float - before it would just fail)
- Promoted platformer snippet to a full sample
- Separated Okapi Kit and the samples in two different packages

  - Singletons are objects that enforce only one existing and that survive scene transitions

- Added Probe component, which allows for raycasts to be performed and used in conditions
- Added stop distance option on Follow Movement
- Added condition negation option
- Added "Else" clause for condition trigger, which is run if the condition is false
- Action and Condition arrays no longer state "Element x" in them, adding space
- Actions can now be dragged directly to the Actions element of triggers, without creating one first
