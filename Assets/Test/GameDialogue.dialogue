// This defines a named dialogue (WizardHello in this case)
# WizardHello
[Wizard]: Help, adventurer!

These goblins stole my key! Can you get it back for me?
*No, I'm scared! -> WizardHello:No
*Yes, let's go! -> WizardHello:Yes

# WizardHello:No
[Wizard]: Oh, too bad... :(

# WizardHello:Yes
[Wizard]: Yay!

// This one evaluates the expression inside the {} and goes to the first text that matches - this requires a implementation of the UCExpression.IContext interface in the same GameObject as the DialogueManager
/*{TutorialStage == 0}=>IntroText
{TutorialStage == 2}=>PresentSeed

# IntroText
{OneShot}
[TestSpeaker]: Welcome, Unlighted One!

I'm so happy you're here! Now, we can bring light back!

Darkness is very dangerous! Walk in the dark for a bit and you'll see!
// When this dialogue finishes, the code will be called. Code can be attributions (var = expression) or function calls (functionName(...))
=>{    
    TutorialStage = 1;
}

# Death1
[TestSpeaker]: See?!
Dangerous!!

But don't worry, you will always come back, although something may be lost in the process!
// When this text finishes, it will continue on the given text (in this case Death1:Question)
=>Death1:Question

# Death1:Question
[TestSpeaker]: Are you ready to go on? 
// This represents a choice in the dialog. Each of the options lead to a different text element
*No, I'm scared! -> Death1:No
*Yes, let's go! -> Death1:Yes

# Death1:No
[TestSpeaker]: Don't be, as an Unlighted you always come back, even if it is unpleasant!
=>Death1:Question

# Death1:Yes
[TestSpeaker]: Yay! Very well! Follow the light and find the exit, I'll meet you in the other side!
=>{
    TutorialStage = 2;

# PresentSeed
[TestSpeaker]: You're here! I knew you could do it!

Now, grab that shovel over there, we're going to do something really neat!
